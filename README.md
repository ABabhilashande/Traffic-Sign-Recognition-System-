# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-System-
Smart Traffic Signal Optimization System using IoT and Sensors to reduce congestion and improve vehicle flow at intersections.

🚦 Traffic Signal Optimization System
📌 Project Overview
The Traffic Signal Optimization System is a smart IoT-based application designed to dynamically control traffic signals based on real-time traffic density. This project aims to reduce vehicle congestion, improve traffic flow efficiency, and minimize waiting time at intersections using sensor-based data and intelligent algorithms.

🎯 Features
🚗 Real-Time Traffic Detection using IR or camera sensors

🧠 Smart Signal Timing Algorithm that adjusts based on traffic density

📊 Priority-Based Signal Switching (e.g., emergency vehicle prioritization)

🗂️ Data logging for historical traffic analysis

🛠️ Tech Stack
Hardware: Arduino / Raspberry Pi, IR Sensors / Camera Module

Software: Python / C++, OpenCV (if using cameras), MQTT / HTTP Protocols

Optional: Flask / Node.js for Web UI, Firebase / MySQL for data storage
